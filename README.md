subgraph Architecture
	vault["🔐 VAULT"] -. "credentials" .-> app["✨ APP"]
	app -- grpc --> store["🏪 STORE"]
	store --> database["📁 DATABSE"]
end
```

- `🔐 VAULT`: We can manage who can access store.
- `🏪 STORE` provides grpc interface, same ORM for all languages
- Scale up `✨ APP` -> Don't add direct pressure to database.
